A cljs version of the paratrooper game

## Usage
If you would like to build this for to work on it, it uses the
[boot][boot-github] build tool. Install the build tool. Then you can clone
the repo. From the root of the project run `boot dev`. This will start building
the project then run a simple webserver hosting the site at `localhost:8080`.
